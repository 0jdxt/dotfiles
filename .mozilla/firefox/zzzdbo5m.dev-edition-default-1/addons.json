The Facebook Container extension for Firefox helps you take control and isolate your web activity from Facebook.","fullDescription":"What does it do?\nFacebook Container works by isolating your Facebook identity into a separate container that makes it harder for Facebook to track your visits to other websites with third-party cookies.\n\nHow does it work?\nInstalling this extension closes your Facebook tabs, deletes your Facebook cookies, and logs you out of Facebook.\nThe next time you navigate to Facebook it will load in a new blue colored browser tab (the “Container”).\nYou can log in and use Facebook normally when in the Facebook Container. If you click on a non-Facebook link or navigate to a non-Facebook website in the URL bar, these pages will load outside of the container.\nClicking Facebook Share buttons on other browser tabs will load them within the Facebook Container. You should know that using these buttons passes information to Facebook about the website that you shared from.\n\nWhich website features will not function?\nBecause you will be logged into Facebook only in the Container, embedded Facebook comments and Like buttons in tabs outside the Facebook Container will not work. This prevents Facebook from associating information about your activity on websites outside of Facebook to your Facebook identity.\n\nIn addition, websites that allow you to create an account or log in using your Facebook credentials will generally not work properly. Because this extension is designed to separate Facebook use from use of other websites, this behavior is expected.\n\nWhat does Facebook Container NOT protect against?\nIt is important to know that this extension doesn’t prevent Facebook from mishandling the data that it already has, or permitted others to obtain, about you. Facebook still will have access to everything that you do while you are on facebook.com, including your Facebook comments, photo uploads, likes, any data you share with Facebook connected apps, etc.\n\nRather than stop using a service you find valuable, we think you should have tools to limit what data others can obtain. This extension focuses on limiting Facebook tracking, but other ad networks may try to correlate your Facebook activities with your regular browsing. In addition to this extension, you can change your Facebook settings, use Private Browsing, enable Tracking Protection, block third-party cookies, and/or use Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension to further limit tracking.\n\nWhat data does Mozilla receive from this extension?\nMozilla does not collect data from your use of the Facebook Container extension. We do receive the number of times the extension is installed or removed. Learn more\n\nOther Containers\nFacebook Container leverages the Containers feature that is already built in to Firefox. When you enable Facebook Container, you may also see Containers named Personal, Work, Shopping, and Banking while you browse. If you wish to use multiple Containers, you’ll have the best user experience if you install the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension. Learn more about Containers on our support site.\n\nKnown Issues\nWhen Facebook is open and you navigate to another website using the same tab (by entering an address, doing a search, or clicking a bookmark), the new website will be loaded outside of the Container and you will not be able to navigate back to Facebook using the back button in the browser.\n\nNOTE: If you are a Multi-Account Containers user who has already assigned Facebook to a Container, this extension will not work. In an effort to preserve your existing Container set up and logins, this add-on will not include the additional protection to keep other sites out of your Facebook Container. If you would like this additional protection, first unassign facebook.com in the Multi-Account Container extension, and then install this extension.\n\nWhat version of Firefox do I need for this?\nThis extension works with Firefox 57 and higher on Desktop. Note that it does not work on other browsers and it does not work on Firefox for mobile.\n\nIf you believe you are using Firefox 57+, but the install page is telling you that you are not on a supported browser, you can try installing by selecting or copying and pasting this link. (This may be occurring because you have set a preference or installed an extension that causes your browser to obscure its user agent for privacy or other reasons.)\n\nHow does this compare to the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension?\nFacebook Container specifically isolates Facebook and works automatically. Firefox Multi-Account Containers is a more general extension that allows you to create containers and determine which sites open in each container.\n\nYou can use Multi-Account Containers to create a container for Facebook and assign facebook.com to it. Multi-Account Containers will then make sure to only open facebook.com in the Facebook Container. However, unlike Facebook Container, Multi-Account Containers doesn’t prevent you from opening non-Facebook sites in your Facebook Container. So users of Multi-Account Containers need to take a bit extra care to make sure they leave the Facebook Container when navigating to other sites. In addition, Facebook Container assigns some Facebook-owned sites like Instagram and Messenger to the Facebook Container. With Multi-Account Containers, you will have to assign these in addition to facebook.com.\n\nFacebook Container also deletes Facebook cookies from your other containers on install and when you restart the browser, to clean up any potential Facebook trackers. Multi-Account Containers does not do that for you.\n\nReport Issues\nIf you come across any issues with this extension, please let us know by filing an issue here.

Convert tabs to a list and reduce browser memory","fullDescription":"Whenever you find yourself with too many tabs, click the OneTab icon to convert all of your tabs into a list. When you need to access the tabs again, you can either restore them individually or all at once.\n\nWhen your tabs are in the OneTab list, you will save memory and CPU utilization because you will have reduced the number of tabs open in your browser.\n\nPrivacy assurance\n\nInformation about your tabs are never transmitted or disclosed to either the OneTab developers or any other party. The only exception to this is if you intentionally click on our 'share as a web page' feature that allows you to upload your list of tabs into a web page in order to share them with others. Tabs are never shared unless you specifically use the 'share as a web page' button. We use Google's favicon generator to retrieve favicons for each domain in your list, but only the domain name is used and the full URL is never disclosed.\n\nAdditional Benefits\n\nDepending on how many scripts are running inside your tabs, moving them to OneTab can also speed up your computer by reducing the CPU load. We have also had reports that this also contributes to your computer resuming from sleep more quickly.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use my browser history?\nA: Your browser history contains every site you've ever visited. OneTab is typically used to store just the smaller selection of open tabs you are not finished with yet - such as when you are mid way through researching a topic.\n\nFAQ: Why do I need OneTab, when I can just use the \"bookmark all tabs\" browser feature?\nA: OneTab is the quickest way, with only one click, to store all of your open tabs into a list. Once they are in your list, OneTab makes it much easier to scan over, delete, label and manage your list of saved tabs. There are also plenty of special options and features, such as the ability to exclude certain web sites, to remove duplicates, and to export/import tabs.","weeklyDownloads":5760,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"OneTab Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/10945418/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/174/174500.png?modified=1543520208","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.171,"reviewCount":930,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/onetab/reviews/","updateDate":1564148560000},{"id":"{2e5ff8c8-32fe-46d0-9fc8-6b8986621f3c}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/824/824288-32.png?modified=19a734a9","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/824/824288-64.png?modified=19a734a9","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/824/824288-128.png?modified=19a734a9"},"name":"Search by Image","version":"2.1.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3510490/search_by_image-2.1.1-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image","supportURL":"https://github.com/dessant/search-by-image/issues","description":"A powerful reverse image search tool, with support for various search engines, such as Google, Bing, Yandex, Baidu and TinEye.","fullDescription":"Search by Image is a Firefox extension which enables you to initiate a reverse image search from the right-click context menu or the browser toolbar, and comes with support for more than 20 search engines.\n\nImages positioned at the selected area are detected regardless of how they were embedded in the page.

In the future we might be able to implement a more granular approach but it's not exactly trivial.\n\n    Access your data for all websites - required for the style elements to be added into the page, not to access any of your data.\n    Access browser tabs - required to show styles in the popup, and for some auxiliary features like regexp tester in the editor.\n    Access browser activity during navigation - required to insert the styles at the exact moment the page is navigated to a different URL.\n    Identity - required for access to cloud services to allow importing and exporting of styles (e.g. Dropbox, etc).\n\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nUnlike other similar extensions, we don't find you to be all that interesting. Your questionable browsing history should remain between you and the NSA. Stylus collects nothing. Period.\n\n\nFirefox related notes\n\n    To import styles from Stylish add-on please read https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/FAQ#how-can-i-export-my-user-styles-from-stylish-for-firefox-to-stylus\n    Stylus doesn't apply userstyles to the browser UI or the built-in pages like about:addons because there's no WebExtension API for dynamic application of CSS. You may use another extension that runs an externally installed companion utility to modify userChrome.css and userContent.css and restart Firefox. This restriction is imposed intentionally by Mozilla for security purposes. We don't plan to incorporate the above-mentioned workaround. See https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/Styling-Firefox-UI\n    Export backups of your database frequently. The main reason we've kept the \"beta\" status for so long is because WebExtension support is still a work in progress for Firefox. Many Firefox specific workarounds have been implemented, but backing up your DB regularly will save you a lot of aggravation should something happen to go wrong.","weeklyDownloads":3881,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Stylus Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13438734/"},"developers":[{"name":"Jeremy Schomery","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/11568224/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","width":700,"height":517,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184539.png?modified=1543520845","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":473,"caption":"Promo"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184538.png?modified=1543520846","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Editor"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","width":843,"height":597,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200986.png?modified=1543520849","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":453,"caption":"Manager - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","width":970,"height":865,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200987.png?modified=1543520853","thumbnailWidth":538,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Editor - showing RegExp tester and colorpicker"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","width":538,"height":610,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200985.png?modified=1543520855","thumbnailWidth":423,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - customizing a usercss style"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","width":576,"height":727,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/200/200988.png?modified=1543520857","thumbnailWidth":380,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Popup - finding styles"}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5745,"reviewCount":244,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/reviews/","updateDate":1568299494000},{"id":"{b3e677f4-1150-4387-8629-da738260a48e}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/776/776805-32.png?modified=d0ed208c","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/776/776805-64.png?modified=d0ed208c","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/776/776805-128.png?modified=d0ed208c"},"name":"Smart HTTPS","version":"0.2.9","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3353106/smart_https-0.2.9-an+fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://mybrowseraddon.com/smart-https.html","supportURL":"https://mybrowseraddon.com/smart-https.html","description":"This extension automatically changes HTTP web addresses to the secure HTTPS, whenever possible.","fullDescription":"Smart HTTPS is a Firefox extension that helps you always use the secure HTTPS protocol, if supported by the site’s server. It automatically changes HTTP protocol to the secure HTTPS, and if loading errors occur, the extension will revert back to the original HTTP protocol.\n\nHTTP vs. HTTPS — why it matters\n\nHTTP, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol, is the way a server communicates with the browser. HTTP enables visitors to view a website and send information back and forth to the server. HTTPS, or Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol Secure, is communication through a secure connection. Communications through HTTPS are encrypted by a secure certificate known as an SSL. The encryption prevents third-parties from eavesdropping on communications to and from the server. Read more about HTTPS here.\n\nKey features:\n\na. Automatically change all HTTP requests to the secure HTTPS\nb. All websites (addresses) that do not support HTTPS are remembered in order to speed up the protocol-check process. Note that you can see and delete these items from the extension's Options page.\nc.

Since Oxford says some words are valid both ways, I kept both and the user decides which he prefers. A good example is: \"online\" and \"on-line\".\nFor ize/ise, both ways are accepted in some words:\n— optimize/optimise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/optimize;\n— realize/realise: https://lexico.com/en/definition/realize.\nOxford Dictionaries will only refer that certain words accept both ize/ise for Premium accounts.\nThe regular user won't know by accessing the Oxford site, but I have access to it.\n\nPlaces from New Zealand/UK (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland):\nOn V2.61–2.64 I included tons of place names.\nMy scientist friend, Peter McGavin, told me that in NZ they use British, so I decided to do something about it. I did the same for UK. I searched on Wikipedia for \"towns\", \"counties\", \"villages\", \"boroughs\", \"suburbs\", etc. and based me on:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_England;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civil_parishes_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_places_in_Scotland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_communities_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_Wales;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_towns_and_villages_in_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counties_of_Northern_Ireland;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Suburbs_in_New_Zealand;\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Church_of_Scotland_parishes.\nAlso, added places sent to me by Peter C.:\n© OpenStreetMap contributors: www.openstreetmap.org/copyright.\n© The Clergy of the Church of England Database Project, 2005.\n\nCities from Australia\nOn V2.65 I added the cities in Australia by population, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Australia_by_population.\n\nCities from US\nOn V2.65 I added tons of cities in the US with a 10 000+ population, since they are in valid English.\nThis list was supplied by Michael Holroyd on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\n\nCities from Canada\nOn V2.67 I added the cities in Canada, since they are in valid English:\n— https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_in_Canada.\n\nCommon prescription and OTC drugs\nOn V2.63 I added tons of drugs names supplied by Andrew Ziem on Kevin Atkinson's GitHub.\nThe generic drugs (such as \"diphenhydramine\") are in lowercase, while the brand names (such as \"Abilify\") are capitalised.\n\nMain difficulties developing this dictionary:\n1) Proper names;\n2) Possessive forms;\n3) Plurals.\n\nAdding new words:\nIf you believe to have found a missing/incorrect word, please send it to me for analysis. If it is on the Oxford or Collins dictionaries, I will add it.\n\nRemoving US words:\nIf you find American words, which appear both in Oxford and Collins dictionaries as such with a British correspondence, please send them to me for analysis and removal.\n\nArchaic words:\nI will only add archaic words if they don't interfere with other words.\n\n\nI developed Proofing Tool GUI (open-source tool) hoping someone would improve the GB speller, but months went by and no one volunteered, so I took the task myself in 2013.\n\nI have created the best up-to-date British speller. It encompasses several fields of knowledge, from simple to complex words.\n\nIt doesn't matter your religion, sex, age or academic background, everyone should have access to all words equally for free.\n\nTo make sure the words I add are the correct ones, I have been looking for them in credible sources:\n1) Oxford Dictionaries;\n2) Collins Dictionary;\n3) Macmillan Dictionary;\n4) Cambridge Dictionary;\n5) Merriam-Webster Dictionary (used with caution ⚠);\n6) Wiktionary (used with caution ⚠);\n7) Wikipedia (used with caution ⚠);\n8) Physical dictionaries.\n\nIn January 2015 I purchased an \"Oxford Gold Account\" to have a higher access in Oxford Dictionaries.\n\nI am also involved on several projects with a specific jargon having added some \"special\" words.\n\nI am adding the words with copy/paste after checking them in the dictionaries mentioned above.

This WebExtension is inspired by Self Destructing Cookies. When a tab closes, any cookies not being used are automatically deleted. Whitelist the ones you trust while deleting the rest. Support for Container Tabs.","fullDescription":"Please don't use reviews for support request or feature requests. Use GitHub instead.\n\nBefore opening a GitHub Issue, please check the troubleshooting FAQ first. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nPermission Request Explanations\n- Access your data for all websites: CAD requests this to delete cookies for all sites\n- Clear recent browsing history, cookies and related data: Ability to delete Localstorage.\n- Display notifications to you: Self explanatory.\n- Read and modify privacy settings: Automatic detection of First Party Isolation support. Although the Privacy permission gives CAD \"read and modify\" permissions, NO MODIFICATIONS are done to your privacy settings, CAD only reads the setting of First Party Isolation. The privacy permission unfortunately cannot be given granular control, so this will stay for now.\n- Access browser tabs: CAD uses this permission to display the site hostname in the popup for easy whitelisting/greylisting, displaying the amount of cookies for that site, and which rules apply to that site.\n\nTake the permission wording with a grain of salt.\n\nMain Features\n- Auto Deletes Cookies from Closed Tabs\n- WhiteList/GreyList Support for Cookies\n- Easily Export/Import your Whitelist/Greylist\n- Clear All Cookies for a Domain\n- Supports Manual Mode Cleaning from the popup\n- Easily See the Number of Cookies for a site\n- Support for Container Tabs (Firefox 53+ Only)\n\nUsage\nThis extension does not clean cookies automatically until you enable \"Auto-clean\". This gives you the chance to add sites to the WhiteList.\n\n1. Add the sites you want to keep cookies in the WhiteList (permanently) or GreyList (until Browser restart)\n2. Toggle \"Auto-clean\" in the popup or \"Automatic cleaning\" in the settings\n3. Watch those unused cookies disappear :)\n\nYou must enable cookies in the browser as this extension will replace the internal cookie manager.\n\nYou can disable Cleanup Notifications via the Settings.\n\nPopup Menu Features\nClean: This is basically a quick way of activating the Cookie Cleanup on demand. This looks at all your cookies and deletes them if they are not in any Open Tabs or the WhiteList.\nClean, include open tabs: Same thing as Cookie Cleanup except that it only deletes cookies only if they are not in the WhiteList. Open tabs are not taken into consideration.\nClear All Cookies for This Domain: Easy way to delete all cookies for one particular domain that you are on.\n\nSome things to Note:\n- This extension can clear localstorage as of version 2.1.0 and Firefox 58+. Enable it in the settings.\n\n- Even though third party cookies are cleared with this extension, it is better to disable third party cookies from the settings\n\nDocumentation\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nIf you have any other problem, file an issue on GitHub. Maybe we can work it out. Note that support may not be available for variants of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome.\n\nBTC: 16km6pFV33S6kaeb8rCaDLZXUyo3uyVnsk","weeklyDownloads":9060,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"CAD Team","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12748480/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189656.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Popup"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","width":413,"height":135,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/185/185648.png?modified=1543520768","thumbnailWidth":413,"thumbnailHeight":135,"caption":"Notifications"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189657.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Settings"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/189/189658.png?modified=1543520769","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400,"caption":"Expression Table"}],"contributionURL":"https://www.paypal.me/mrkennyd/5?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5806,"reviewCount":453,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/reviews/","updateDate":1580434210000},{"id":"@react-devtools","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/649/649896-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"React Developer Tools","version":"4.4.0","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3478747/react_developer_tools-4.4.0-fx.xpi?src=","homepageURL":"https://github.com/facebook/react","supportURL":null,"description":"React Developer Tools is a tool that allows you to inspect a React tree, including the component hierarchy, props, state, and more.

Example - rest-service.com/user/{{userId}}. You can then set userId in a seperate panel, and it will be resolved across all your different requests.\n    Collections: Save your requests to local storage for easy reuse later.\n    Basic auth and custom headers: Easily set basic auth and custom headers that are passed alongside the request.\n    Imports: Import data from HAR (HTTP Archive), or from a Postman collection\n    Modern design: Based on modern technology and minimalist web design, this extension is anything but dated. It also features changeable themes to make it yours.\n\n\nSince this is a relatively new project, I am also happy to announce that it is also awesomely easy to contribute to the project!
